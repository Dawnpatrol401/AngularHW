### Assignment Instructions

* Create a basic html file template that includes several <div> sections with ids.
In another location, create a TypeScript file. It can be called whatever you want but the shorter the
better. Make sure the file extension is ".ts" such as "someFile.ts".
* Compile the file by to the proper folder in the command prompt and compiling with the tsc command. Note the name of the produced JavaScript file.
Reference the JavaScript file from the html page, then launch the html page in a browser to verify the output.
* Next, create a class called Person in the file below the getElementById() method . Give it the properties of first name, last name, age, phone number, state, zip code, and occupation. Create a constructor to initialize these properties. Also create several method to return combinations of interest, such as Full name, Name and Phone Number, Location, etc.
* Next, create several people and, mimicing the method above, assign the output of some of their
infomration to various <div> sections in your page.
* Add a hourlyWage property to the person (and if you want, rename the class to Employee ). Add a function that calculates a weekly wage and takes the number of hours as an optional parameter. If it is not presented, use a typical 40 hours to calculate the wage. Display this in a area that states the name of the person and their weekly wage.
